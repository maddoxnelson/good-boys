# They're good dogs

This is a serverless server-side app with Express and Next.js. Say that five times fast.

## Run it locally:

You can't deploy it, since you don't have my api creds, and you can't run the backend unless you have all the data pulled in (going to add instrux for that if you're really committed), but you _can_ run the app!

Clone this down, and do:

`cd client`
`npm install && npm run dev`

Go to `http://localhost:4375`.

> Note: You'll notice that hot reloading doesn't work. This is because I was lazy. I'll get to it.
